More than 60 people are feared dead after a boat carrying migrants was found off Cape Verde in West Africa. Thirty-eight people, including children, were rescued, with footage showing them being helped ashore, some on stretchers, on the island of Sal. The survivors include four children aged between 12 and 16, a spokesperson for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said.
